# Email Setup Guide for Thinkify Labs Form

The form uses **100% FREE** email services with robust fallback options for production environments.

## 🚀 Production-Ready Setup (Recommended)

For maximum reliability, set up multiple fallback options:

### 1. **Primary: Gmail SMTP (Free)**
### 2. **Fallback: Formspree (Free tier)**
### 3. **Development: Console logging**

This ensures your form **never fails** - if Gmail is down, it uses Formspree. If both fail, it logs to console.

   GMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

4. **Restart your development server**:
